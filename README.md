Gameplay
Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle. The objective is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points. The game continues until one player decides to quit.

The ball will bounce off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the game window. If the ball passes a player's paddle, the opponent scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center.

* Player 1 (Left Paddle):
      - Move Up: W
      - Move Down: S
* Player 2 (Right Paddle):
      - Move Up: UP Arrow
      - Move Down: DOWN Arrow
